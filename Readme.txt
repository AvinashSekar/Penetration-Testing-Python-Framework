This is the work for my school assignment to create a python script for doing a set of works defined as follows

IP/Port Scanning :

The Port Scanner tool displays which ports on a network are open for communication. Whether or not a port is open can help with setting up IP security cameras, determining if a network is secure, as well as other network-related operations.
To begin, enter a valid IP address or URL at the top of the page. After that, you can scan ports on the IP/URL individually or in pre-made packages. If you are a Gold Member, you can also scan ports in a numeric range or in a custom package (no more than 100 ports at once for any scan type.

Network sniffer and save the result as a PCAP file: 

A packet sniffer — also known as a packet analyzer, protocol analyzer or network analyzer — is a piece of hardware or software used to monitor network traffic. Sniffers work by examining streams of data packets that flow between computers on a network as well as between networked computers and the larger Internet.

Cracking password using Johny:

John the Ripper (JtR) is one of the hacking tools the Varonis IR Team used in the first Live Cyber Attack demo, and one of the most popular password cracking programs out there. In this blog post, we are going to dive into John the Ripper, show you how it works, and explain why it’s important.


vulnerability scanner on given IP:

A vulnerability scanner is software that can detect vulnerabilities within a network, system or application. This is a simple definition for a not so simple process.
For the majority of organisations having a good understanding of your assets along with regular vulnerability scanning is the best bang for buck in getting your security under control.
Once you know where the vulnerabilities are you can assess the risk and work on mitigation (a fancy way of saying reduce the assessed risk).
